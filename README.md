# AtlantisLib â€“ by FRC Team Atlantis 2679

## Overview  
**AtlantisLib** is a utility library built for use with [WPILib](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/stable/index.html) and [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit). It provides a collection of tools that simplify common robot programming tasks, helping FRC teams write cleaner, more maintainable, and more powerful codeâ€”faster.

AtlantisLib helps your team:
- Simplify sensor and subsystem management  
- Enable intuitive real-time value tuning via dashboard  
- Provide a consistent interface for alerts and network messaging  
- Accelerate robot software development without adding unnecessary complexity  

Whether you're building a simple drivetrain or integrating advanced autonomous features, AtlantisLib helps you focus on functionality and eliminate boilerplate code.

## ðŸ•˜ Background  
AtlantisLib was originally developed as an internal library called [RobotBase](https://github.com/Atlantis2679/RobotBase), used by our team for several seasons. As we refined and expanded it, we saw its potential to help other FRC teams as well. Starting in the 2025 season, we've released it to the public under the name **AtlantisLib**. 

Since the library has already gone through multiple major internal iterations, we're starting the public release at **version 4.0.0** to reflect its maturity and stability.
