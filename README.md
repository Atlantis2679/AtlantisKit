# AtlantisKit – by FRC Team Atlantis 2679

## Overview 🧭

**AtlantisKit** is a utility library for WPILib and AdvantageKit. It provides tools that simplify common robot programming tasks, helping FRC teams write cleaner, more maintainable, and more powerful code, faster.

AtlantisKit helps your team:

- Simplify the use of AdvantageKit  
- Tune values live via the dashboard 
- Provide a simple and consistant alerts manager
- Manage sensors and subsystems more easily

## Background 🕘

AtlantisKit started as an internal tool called **RobotBase**, developed and used by our team (Atlantis 2679) over several seasons. As it grew in functionality and stability, we saw its potential to help other teams.

Starting in the **2025 season**, we’re releasing it publicly as AtlantisKit. The first public version is **4.0.0**, as it is a direct.

## Installation 📦
To use AtlantisKit, you need to include [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) and [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/AdvantageScope/AdvantageKit) as dependencies in your robot project. Make sure to add them to your vendordeps or build configuration before including AtlantisKit.

To include AtlantisKit in your robot code, add the following to your vendordeps:

```https://atlantis2679.github.io/AtlantisKit/AtlantisKit.json```

Alternatively, download the `.json` manually and place it in your project's `vendordeps/` folder.
